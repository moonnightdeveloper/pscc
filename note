Web applications are composed of three primary interconnected components: frontend development, backend development, and databases.

Frontend Development:
This refers to the client-side of a web application, encompassing everything a user directly sees and interacts with in their browser.
Frontend development focuses on the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). 

Key technologies and skills include:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): 
Structures the content of web pages.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): 
Styles the appearance of web pages, including layout, colors, and fonts.

JavaScript: 
Adds interactivity, dynamic content, and complex functionality to web pages.
Frontend Frameworks/Libraries: Tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js streamline development and provide pre-built components.

Backend Development:
This involves the server-side of a web application, handling the logic and functionality that users don't directly see. Backend development ensures the application's proper functioning, scalability, and security. Key aspects include:

Server-Side Programming Languages: 
Languages such as Python, Java, Node.js (JavaScript), Ruby, and PHP are used to build the application's logic.

Backend Frameworks: 
Frameworks like Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js simplify development and provide structure.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): 
Enable communication between the frontend and backend, as well as with external services.
Server Management: Handling server configuration, deployment, and maintenance.

Database:
The database serves as the organized repository for storing and managing an application's data. 
It is crucial for persistent data storage and retrieval. 

Databases can be broadly categorized as:
Relational Databases (SQL): 
Store data in structured tables with defined relationships. 
Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

NoSQL Databases: 
Offer more flexible data models and are often used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. 
Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

Relationship between the Components:
The frontend sends requests to the backend (e.g., to retrieve data, submit a form).
The backend processes these requests, often interacting with the database to store or retrieve information.
The backend then sends a response back to the frontend, which updates the user interface accordingly.
In essence, the frontend provides the user-facing experience, the backend handles the underlying logic and data processing, and the database stores the application's information, all working together to deliver a complete and functional web application.
